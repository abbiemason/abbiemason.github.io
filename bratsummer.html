            Charli XCX’s album “Brat” has captured the zeitgeist this summer, sparking a new viral trend known as “Brat Summer.” This trend is characterized by a distinctive fashion style and a carefree, bold mindset that resonates with the party girl aesthetic. The “Brat” look is defined by its edgy, Y2K-inspired fashion with a touch of refinement. It combines elements of a party girl lifestyle with a polished edge, creating a unique style that stands out. However, Brat Summer goes beyond just fashion; it embodies a particular attitude and mindset. In a TikTok interview, Charli XCX explained the essence of being a “Brat” in simple terms: “You’re that girl who is a bit messy and loves to party and maybe says dumb things sometimes. She’s honest, blunt and a little bit volatile. That’s Brat.” The lyrics of her song “Mean Girls” encapsulate this attitude, making it one of the standout tracks of the album.

                <h3 id="point1title">Wear the outfit you were always too afraid to wear</h3> 
                <p id="point1">Another part of having a Brat Summer is through the fits. I know there are some things in your closet right now that you keep “saving for later.” If you’re looking to have a Brat Summer, don’t be scared to branch out of your comfort zone with a green statement piece — or even, following Charli’s lead, a strappy white top with no bra. This is your moment to be bold, experiment with your style, and turn heads. Confidence is key, and the right outfit can be the ultimate form of self-expression.</p> 
                                
                <h3 id="point2title">Do what you want</h3> 
                <p id="point2"> The key to brat summer is living unapologetically. Want to spend the whole day at the beach, binge-watch a show, or skip a workout? Go for it! It’s about following your whims and doing what brings you joy without guilt. Embrace your desires without hesitation, and don’t let anyone make you feel bad for choosing yourself. Brat summer is all about letting go of expectations and fully leaning into what makes you feel carefree and alive.</p>
                                
                <h3 id="point3title">Have fun, by any means necessary</h3> 
                <p id="point3">Lastly, if you’re not having fun, WYD? Having a Brat Summer is all about enjoying life with your girlies. Go out to that party and dance the night away. Do the spontaneous thing, say yes to the unplanned adventures, and create memories that feel wild and free. This also comes with not caring what anyone thinks. In “360,” Charli says, “If you love it, if you hate it/ I don’t f*cking care what you think." So when you go out with your besties, don’t worry about anyone else — it’s your time to live unapologetically and have your fun, no matter what!</p>
