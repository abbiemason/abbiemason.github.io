                <p id="point1-2">Unless you’ve fallen out of a coconut tree, you’ve heard of Brat Green. While pop queen Charli XCX dropped her most recent album, Brat, on June 7, in the weeks since, the electric shade of green has filled feeds everywhere. In most recent events, the colour transcended pop culture fodder and made political news headlines in the U.S. when, upon Joe Biden’s withdrawal as the Democratic nominee and endorsement of Kamala Harris, the British singer-songwriter took to X to declare: “Kamala IS brat.” Harris’ campaign subsequently hopped on the train by adopting a banner featuring the same colour and font as the Brat album cover for the KamalaHQ account.“Brat green” quickly became the color of the season, a far cry from last summer’s ubiquitous Barbie pink.

                    For some New Yorkers, brat green is inescapable: Charli XCX kicked off the "Brat" album release with a live performance in front of a giant green wall in Williamsburg.</p> 
                                
                <h3 id="point2title-2">Brat Summer</h3> 
                <p id="point2-2"> After Kelley did that video and the dance went viral, Kelley said “Charli xcx sent me a super sweet message saying how much she loved the dance and she offered me tickets to her Madison Square Garden show.”
                    ‘Brat Summer’ quicly became one of the most noteable trends of summer 2024. The brat summer trend is inspired by British singer Charli XCX's hit album “Brat,” which was released on June 7 and debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard charts. Fans were particularly taken by the album's distinctive yet minimalistic cover art: “brat” written in low-res font on a lime green background. Soon after the album's release, Gen Z christened it the season of the brat, an aesthetic trend defined by party animal antics, cool-girl style, and lime green everything. The trend quickly took over TikTok, with tens of thousands of posts under the hashtag #bratsummer. </p>
               
                    <h3 id="point3title-2">The 'Apple Dance'</h3> 
                <p id="point3-2"> On June 14, the NYC-based actor posted a dance she made up to “Apple,” an—at that point—“underappreciated” song on Charli XCX’s newest album. Now, the melody is everywhere, thanks largely in part to Heyer, and the dance went so viral that everyone from Charli to the Twisters cast has recreated it.After Kelley did that video and the dance went viral, Kelley said “Charli xcx sent me a super sweet message saying how much she loved the dance and she offered me tickets to her Madison Square Garden show.” </p>
