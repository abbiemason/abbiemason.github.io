        "This album is very direct. I’m over the idea of metaphor and flowery lyricism and not saying exactly what I think, the way I would say it to a friend in a text message. This record is all the things I would talk about with my friends, said exactly how I would say them. It’s in ways very aggressive and confrontational, but also very conversational and personal. And not in that boring way where artists are like, “This is my most personal record.” To me, it feels like listening to a conversation with a friend."

      <p>  Brat was met with widespread acclaim from critics. It debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart and reached the top ten in 12 additional countries, including the US, where it debuted at number three, Charli XCX's highest debut. According to Metacritic, it is the highest rated album of 2024 and the 16th-highest-rated album of all time as of August 2024. The album was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize for 2024 album of the year.
            The cover art and aesthetic became a popular Internet trend, and was adopted by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential campaign after Charli XCX tweeted about the candidate.Brat is Charli XCX's sixth studio album and first after renewing her contract with Atlantic Records in early 2023. It was announced on 28 February 2024, a day before the release of the lead single "Von Dutch".
            According to Charli XCX, Brat is her "most aggressive and confrontational record", but also her most vulnerable. On 22 February, during her Boiler Room warehouse set, she debuted snippets of tracks identified as "Spring Breakers" and "365".She was joined onstage by Addison Rae and Julia Fox; a "Von Dutch" remix with Rae and A. G. Cook was released on 22 March. On 6 March, she premiered "So I" at the Billboard Women in Music event"Club Classics" and "B2B" were released on 3 April as a two-pack promotional single. After teasing the song for a few days, on 29 April, Charli announced the release of the next single, "360". It was released on 10 May alongside its music video, which was teased earlier that day, and was described by her as her "best music video ever". The video features multiple "it girls",including Gabbriette, Chloë Sevigny, Julia Fox, and Rachel Sennott. A remix of "360" soon followed, featuring Swedish artists Robyn and Yung Lean, which was released on 31 May.During her 1 June headlining set at Barcelona's Primavera Sound festival, she debuted two unreleased songs live, "365" and "Everything is Romantic". Brat was released on 7 June 2024. A deluxe edition, titled Brat and It's the Same but There's Three More Songs So It's Not, was released on 10 June, containing three additional songs. On 21 June, a remix version of "Girl, So Confusing" featuring New Zealand singer Lorde was released. On 1 August 2024, a remix version of "Guess" from the deluxe edition was released featuring singer Billie Eilish. The following day, "Apple" was released to Italian radio as the album's third single. On 12 September, a "Talk Talk" remix featuring Troye Sivan was released along with the announcement of a remix album titled Brat and It's Completely Different but Also Still Brat scheduled for 11 October 2024.  </p>
        <p> Brat's artwork and packaging was designed by New York City-based studio Special Offer, Inc.[41] The cover is a lime green square with the title in lowercase imposed in Arial font. In a cover story interview for Vogue Singapore, Charli told Chandreyee Ray that criticism led her to question why fans feel "ownership over female artists" so much so that they demand their photograph be on all their work; she had previously called it "misogynistic and boring" on X. Of the album cover's colour, she said that green was heavily oversaturated in the media and fashion: "I wanted to go with an offensive, off-trend shade of green to trigger the idea of something being wrong. I'd like for us to question our expectations of pop culture—why are some things considered good and acceptable, and some things deemed bad? I'm interested in the narratives behind that and I want to provoke people. I'm not doing things to be nice".[42]
            Despite its simple appearance, the album cover's design underwent a five-month development process, maintaining a green square with text. Freaney selected the colour after examining around 500 shades, aiming for an off-putting, garish effect. The final shade resonated with Charli's vision of bold irreverence. The typography, based on Arial, was chosen for its non-"precious" feel. While considering various Swiss typefaces, Freaney wanted to surpass Helvetica. The text, slightly stretched to "give it a personality", is awkwardly placed to be neither small and tasteful nor large and loud, creating an opinion-less aesthetic.[43]
            In the weeks leading up to Brat's release, a wall in Greenpoint, Brooklyn—which fans called the "brat wall"—was painted and repainted with the album's signature green color and various messages. Over the summer, its messages changed frequently in line with the album's promotion cycle. The first message was "i'm your fav reference"—a lyric from the single "360"—before it was repainted to simply "brat". On June 10, when Brat's deluxe edition was released, the wall was changed to white with the message "brat and it's the same but there's three more songs so it's not". By the middle of June, the wall remained white but changed its message to "lorde", indicating Lorde's possible involvement with future releases pertaining to Brat, which soon appeared in the remix version of "Girl, So Confusing". The final message of the Brat wall—"ok bye!" in the album's signature green—was painted on July 1st 2024.</p>
